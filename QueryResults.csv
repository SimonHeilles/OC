"How can I prevent SQL injection in PHP?","<p>If user input is inserted without modification into an SQL query, then the application becomes vulnerable to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/332367/"">SQL injection</a>, like in the following example:</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>$unsafe_variable = $_POST['user_input']; 

mysql_query(""INSERT INTO `table` (`column`) VALUES ('$unsafe_variable')"");
</code></pre>

<p>That's because the user can input something like <code>value'); DROP TABLE table;--</code>, and the query becomes:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO `table` (`column`) VALUES('value'); DROP TABLE table;--')
</code></pre>

<p>What can be done to prevent this from happening?</p>

"Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?","<p>Here is a piece of C++ code that shows some very peculiar behavior. For some strange reason, sorting the data (<em>before</em> the timed region) miraculously makes the loop almost six times faster.</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    // Generate data
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster.
    std::sort(data, data + arraySize);

    // Test
    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;
    for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
    {
        for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        {   // Primary loop
            if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                sum += data[c];
        }
    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(clock()-start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; elapsedTime &lt;&lt; '\n';
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;sum = &quot; &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; '\n';
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Without <code>std::sort(data, data + arraySize);</code>, the code runs in 11.54 seconds.</li>
<li>With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Sorting itself takes more time than this one pass over the array, so it's not actually worth doing if we needed to calculate this for an unknown array.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly, so I tried Java:</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Generate data
        int arraySize = 32768;
        int data[] = new int[arraySize];

        Random rnd = new Random(0);
        for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;

        // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
        Arrays.sort(data);

        // Test
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
        {
            for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            {   // Primary loop
                if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                    sum += data[c];
            }
        }

        System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);
        System.out.println(&quot;sum = &quot; + sum);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>With a similar but less extreme result.</p>
<hr />
<p>My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache"" rel=""noreferrer"">cache</a>, but then I thought how silly that was because the array was just generated.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is going on?</li>
<li>Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?</li>
</ul>
<p>The code is summing up some independent terms, so the order should not matter.</p>

"NPM vs. Bower vs. Browserify vs. Gulp vs. Grunt vs. Webpack","<p>I'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>npm</code> &amp; <code>bower</code> are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call <code>webpack</code>/<code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> after fetching all the dependencies.</li>
<li><code>bower</code> is like <code>npm</code>, but builds a flattened dependency trees (unlike <code>npm</code> which does it recursively). Meaning <code>npm</code> fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while <code>bower</code> expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes <code>bower</code> and <code>npm</code> are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).</li>
<li><code>grunt</code> and <code>gulp</code> are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).</li>
<li><code>grunt</code> vs. <code>gulp</code> (is like <code>maven</code> vs. <code>gradle</code> or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. </li>
<li><code>webpack</code> (<code>webpack-dev-server</code>) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers. </li>
<li><code>npm</code>/<code>bower</code> + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use <code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> over <code>npm</code> + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. ""on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp"").</li>
<li><code>browserify</code> allows packaging node modules for browsers. <code>browserify</code> vs <code>node</code>'s <code>require</code> is actually <a href=""https://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/"" rel=""noreferrer"">AMD vs CommonJS</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Questions:</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li><em>What is <code>webpack</code> &amp; <code>webpack-dev-server</code>?</em> Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. <em>What's the difference?</em></li>
<li><em>Where would you use <code>browserify</code>? Can't we do the same with node/ES6 imports?</em> </li>
<li><em>When would you use <code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> over <code>npm</code> + plugins?</em></li>

<p><strong>If you have anything to add, please do</strong></p>

<p>Many systems are dependent on keeping accurate time, the problem is with changes to time due to daylight savings - moving the clock forward or backwards.</p>

<p>For instance, one has business rules in an order taking system that depend on the time of the order - if the clock changes, the rules might not be as clear.

"C++11 introduced a standardized memory model. What does it mean? And how is it going to affect C++ programming?","<p>C++11 introduced a standardized memory model, but what exactly does that mean? And how is it going to affect C++ programming?</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/06/11/herb_sutter_next_c_plus_plus/page2.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">This article</a> (by <strong>Gavin Clarke</strong> who quotes <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Sutter"" rel=""noreferrer"">Herb Sutter</a></strong>) says that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The memory model means that C++ code
now has a standardized library to call
regardless of who made the compiler
and on what platform it's running.
There's a standard way to control how
different threads talk to the
processor's memory.</p>
<p>&quot;When you are talking about splitting
[code] across different cores that's
in the standard, we are talking about
the memory model. We are going to
optimize it without breaking the
following assumptions people are going
to make in the code,&quot; <strong>Sutter</strong> said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I can <em>memorize</em> this and similar paragraphs available online (as I've had my own memory model since birth :P) and can even post as an answer to questions asked by others, but to be honest, I don't exactly understand this.</p>
<p>C++ programmers used to develop multi-threaded applications even before, so how does it matter if it's POSIX threads, or Windows threads, or C++11 threads? What are the benefits? I want to understand the low-level details.</p>
<p>I also get this feeling that the C++11 memory model is somehow related to C++11 multi-threading support, as I often see these two together. If it is, how exactly? Why should they be related?</p>
<p>I don't know how the internals of multi-threading work, and what memory model means in general.</p>

"""Large data"" workflows using pandas","<p>I have tried to puzzle out an answer to this question for many months while learning pandas.  I use SAS for my day-to-day work and it is great for it's out-of-core support.  However, SAS is horrible as a piece of software for numerous other reasons.</p>

<p>One day I hope to replace my use of SAS with python and pandas, but I currently lack an out-of-core workflow for large datasets.  I'm not talking about ""big data"" that requires a distributed network, but rather files too large to fit in memory but small enough to fit on a hard-drive.</p>

<p>My first thought is to use <code>HDFStore</code> to hold large datasets on disk and pull only the pieces I need into dataframes for analysis.  Others have mentioned MongoDB as an easier to use alternative.  My question is this:</p>

<p>What are some best-practice workflows for accomplishing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Loading flat files into a permanent, on-disk database structure</li>
<li>Querying that database to retrieve data to feed into a pandas data structure</li>
<li>Updating the database after manipulating pieces in pandas</li>
</ol>

<p>Real-world examples would be much appreciated, especially from anyone who uses pandas on ""large data"".</p>

<p>Edit -- an example of how I would like this to work:</p>

<ol>
<li>Iteratively import a large flat-file and store it in a permanent, on-disk database structure.  These files are typically too large to fit in memory.</li>
<li>In order to use Pandas, I would like to read subsets of this data (usually just a few columns at a time) that can fit in memory.</li>
<li>I would create new columns by performing various operations on the selected columns.</li>
<li>I would then have to append these new columns into the database structure.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am trying to find a best-practice way of performing these steps. Reading links about pandas and pytables it seems that appending a new column could be a problem.</p>

<p>Edit -- Responding to Jeff's questions specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li>I am building consumer credit risk models. The kinds of data include phone, SSN and address characteristics; property values; derogatory information like criminal records, bankruptcies, etc... The datasets I use every day have nearly 1,000 to 2,000 fields on average of mixed data types: continuous, nominal and ordinal variables of both numeric and character data.  I rarely append rows, but I do perform many operations that create new columns.</li>
<li>Typical operations involve combining several columns using conditional logic into a new, compound column. For example, <code>if var1 &gt; 2 then newvar = 'A' elif var2 = 4 then newvar = 'B'</code>.  The result of these operations is a new column for every record in my dataset.</li>
<li>Finally, I would like to append these new columns into the on-disk data structure.  I would repeat step 2, exploring the data with crosstabs and descriptive statistics trying to find interesting, intuitive relationships to model.</li>
<li>A typical project file is usually about 1GB.  Files are organized into such a manner where a row consists of a record of consumer data.  Each row has the same number of columns for every record.  This will always be the case.</li>
<li>It's pretty rare that I would subset by rows when creating a new column.  However, it's pretty common for me to subset on rows when creating reports or generating descriptive statistics.  For example, I might want to create a simple frequency for a specific line of business, say Retail credit cards.  To do this, I would select only those records where the line of business = retail in addition to whichever columns I want to report on.  When creating new columns, however, I would pull all rows of data and only the columns I need for the operations.</li>
<li>The modeling process requires that I analyze every column, look for interesting relationships with some outcome variable, and create new compound columns that describe those relationships.  The columns that I explore are usually done in small sets.  For example, I will focus on a set of say 20 columns just dealing with property values and observe how they relate to defaulting on a loan.  Once those are explored and new columns are created, I then move on to another group of columns, say college education, and repeat the process.  What I'm doing is creating candidate variables that explain the relationship between my data and some outcome.  At the very end of this process, I apply some learning techniques that create an equation out of those compound columns.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is rare that I would ever add rows to the dataset.  I will nearly always be creating new columns (variables or features in statistics/machine learning parlance).</p>

"How to generate a self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL?","<p>I'm adding HTTPS support to an embedded Linux device. I have tried to generate a self-signed certificate with these steps:</p>

<pre><code>openssl req -new &gt; cert.csr

openssl x509 -in cert.csr -out cert.pem -req -signkey key.pem -days 1001
cat key.pem&gt;&gt;cert.pem

<p>This works, but I get some errors with, for example, Google Chrome:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is probably not the site you are looking for!<br>
  The site's security certificate is not trusted!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I missing something? Is this the correct way to build a self-signed certificate?</p>

"What are Long-Polling, Websockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE) and Comet?","<p>I have tried reading some articles, but I am not very clear on the concepts yet.</p>

<p>Would someone like to take a shot at explaining to me what these technologies are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Long Polling</li>
<li>Server-Sent Events</li>
<li>Websockets</li>
<li>Comet</li>
</ol>

<p>One thing that I came across every time was, the server keeps a connection open and pushes data to the client. How is the connection kept open, and how does the client get the pushed data? (How does the client use the data, maybe some code might help?)</p>

<p>Now, which one of them should I use for a real-time app. I have been hearing a lot about websockets (with socket.io [a node.js library]) but why not PHP?</p>
